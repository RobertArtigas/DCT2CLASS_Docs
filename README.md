# The Dictionary to Class Generator (DCT2CLASS)

The **DCT2CLASS** templates takes a dictionary definition and generates a base class (form), a list class (list), and the templates to apply these classes to a local procedure. It builds the basic infrastructure that can be further customized. **It is a generator.** After the generation is done all you have is just source code.
